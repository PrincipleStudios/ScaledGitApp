<H1>Demonstration of Text Components</H1>

<Prose>
	Text components are basic building blocks for standard styles. They can
	be used for explaining what a page is, providing debugging instructions,
	or any number of other things.
</Prose>

<H2>Standard styles</H2>
<Prose>
	Because these are intended as building blocks, they allow for any HTML
	attributes to be passed to them, but that doesn't mean they should always
	be used like this. You should only be using these components as-is (as in
	this document) or with additional styles in further components.
</Prose>

<H2>Building Blocks</H2>
<Prose>
	When leveraging these components as building blocks, consider using the
	`.extend` functionality to create new standard styles.
</Prose>
{/* MDX auto-formats and syntax highlights this in various odd ways, so I'm
explicitly using the `children` prop here, although it is not necessary. */}
<Code children={`const ErrorMessage = Prose.extend(
	'ErrorMessage', 
	(T) => <T className="text-red-800 dark:text-red-200" />
);`}/>
<HintText>
	Using this technique, you can keep your presentational components clean
	and encapsulate styles in a more reusable way.
